                        Throughout high school, I made academics and church activities my top priorities. I took IB classes, and I was active in the Bible study club. My grades were always a source of pride for me, but most importantly, they represented my commitment to excellence and my desire to honor my faith in all areas of my life. Moreover, my experiences in high school taught me valuable lessons that helped me thrive in college. I learned how to prioritize my studies, manage my time effectively, and balance my academic and personal commitments. I also developed strong study habits and research skills that have been invaluable in college, where I am pursuing an advanced degree. My faith has also been a constant source of inspiration and consolation throughout my educational journey. Through prayer and reflection, I have found the strength and resilience to navigate the challenges and achieve my goals. I have also found a supportive community of fellow believers who have provided me with spiritual guidance and emotional support. High school can be fun, and AST can prepare you for many universities out there. Make sure to focus on yourself during high school so college feels like a breeze.
